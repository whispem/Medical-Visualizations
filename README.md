**MedicalVisualizationsApp** is an interactive **SwiftUI** project that brings complex biomedical phenomena to life through **real-time, animated scientific visualizations**.  
It integrates dynamic 2D simulations of **tumor growth**, **multi-omics data integration**, and **drug response behavior**, showcasing the intersection of code, science, and design.

## 🔹 Features

- **3D-inspired 2D medical simulations** with smooth real-time animation  
- **Three distinct interactive modules:**
  1. 🧬 **Tumor Microenvironment Visualization**  
     Simulates tumor cell growth, vascularization, oxygen diffusion, and immune infiltration.  
  2. 🧠 **Multi-Omics Integration View**  
     Displays genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics layers connected by real-time correlations.  
  3. 💊 **Drug Response Simulation**  
     Models drug diffusion, apoptosis, IC50 dynamics, and cellular survival rate changes over time.
- **Responsive UI Controls:** toggle visibility of metrics and simulations  
- **Dynamic Metrics:** real-time updating of biological parameters  
- **Elegant Neon Aesthetic:** smooth gradients, particle backgrounds, and glowing cellular effects  
- **SwiftUI Canvas Rendering:** efficient and GPU-accelerated medical visuals
